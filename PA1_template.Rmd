## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header = TRUE)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
require(ggplot2)
mu_steps = aggregate(steps ~ date, data, mean)
colnames(mu_steps)[2] = "mu_steps"
var_steps = aggregate(steps ~ date, data, var)
colnames(var_steps)[2] = "var_steps"
merge(mu_steps,var_steps,by="date")
sum_steps = aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
hist(sum_data$steps, main="Distribution of sum(steps) per day", xlab="sum(steps)", breaks = 10d)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
```{r}
c("NA in steps", length(which(is.na(data$steps))))
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
